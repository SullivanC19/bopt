This project currently implements the class ``DL85Classifier`` for learning optimal classification trees using the DL8.5 algorithm.
 The documentation for this class is given below. 
 We are working on support for other types of models and documentation for this
 will be added later. A preview of the interface for other models can be found in the examples.
