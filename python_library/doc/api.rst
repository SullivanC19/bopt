.. This page shows different classifiers implemented in our project
of optimal decision trees. Unfortunately, we just have one for the
moment but it has many features and we hope it will be helpful for
you. We will try as soon as possible to add another classifiers or
add other features to this one. Any contributions are welcomed. Feel
free to contact us :-)

For classification purposes this project implements the class ``DL85Classifier``.
 The documentation for this class is given below. 
 We are working on support for other types of models and documentation for this
 will be added later. Any contributions are welcome. Feel
free to contact us :-)
