.. This page shows different classifiers implemented in our project
of optimal decision trees. Unfortunately, we just have one for the
moment but it has many features and we hope it will be helpful for
you. We will try as soon as possible to add another classifiers or
add other features to this one. Any contributions are welcomed. Feel
free to contact us :-)

This project currently implements one class ``DL85Classifier``.
 The documentation for this class is given below. 
 We aim to add other classifiers as soon as possible. Any contributions are welcome. Feel
free to contact us :-)
